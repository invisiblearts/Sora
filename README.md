Sora's Minus -- A WOW UI derived from [Sora's](https://git.oschina.net/Neavo/sora)
====

Since Neavo, the original author of Sora's, is nearly AFK, this fork intends to provide a more raid-friendly version.

* Branch Master: Provides a flavored variant that meets the need of me... Includes bug fixes and new features. Best on 1440p, and for shadow priests.

* Branch Vanilla: Original taste, with bug fixes. Hopefully changes here will eventually be merged upstream.

* Branch Dev: Dangerous area. Development here will finally be merged into Master. Full of untested messy codes. UNTESTED AND MESSY. UNTESTED AND MESSY. Important things should be said three times.

Please feel free to raise [issues](https://github.com/invisiblearts/Sora/issues). Pull requests also welcome.

Note: Some of the plugins here are unlicensed and probably unauthorized. If you feel your rights are violated, please contact me. It is currently the common practice despite the fact that this is, strictly, inadequate.

Lists of potentially questionable plugins:

* Angry World Quests
* Bug Sack
* FreebTip
* Garrison Mission Manager
* Interrupt Announcer
* Mapster
* ncHoverBind
* Nomi Cakes
* tekKompare

Well, that's quite a lot...
